Our project belongs to Feigu7 project, which serves as a intermediate link for a price comparison platform of online-retailers. In details, it contains the following steps:

1) crawling the information of second-hand cars on the internet with Python codes;
2) modelling the results in Hive and calculating the depreciation rate of each car;
3) enabling the search function of car information on the webpage for data display.
